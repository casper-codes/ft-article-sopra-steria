                            Cyber threats do not respect borders, digital or

                            From corrupted payment infrastructure in Madrid to a
                            disrupted transport network throughout the UK and
                            blackouts in Oslo, these hypothetical scenarios show how
                            quickly disruption could ripple across Europe's daily
                            life – crossing industries and countries in hours,
                            sometimes minutes.

                        The sophistication of these attacks demands an equally
                        sophisticated response, but this cyber resilience cannot be
                        built in silos.

                        These cases highlight why a multifaceted, cross-border and
                        cross-sector approach to cyber security is required in
                        today's hyper-connected society.
